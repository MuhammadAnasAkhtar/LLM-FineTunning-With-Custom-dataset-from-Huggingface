# Fine-Tuning LLaMA-2 on Custom Dataset
The goal of this project is to fine-tune the LLaMA-2 model using a text-based dataset to enhance its ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses based on the provided text input.

# Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

transformers
datasets
torch
peft (for parameter-efficient fine-tuning)
# Dataset Structure
The dataset "mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k" consists of plain text entries. Each entry serves as a prompt for the model without any predefined structure like instruction, source, or output.

# Setup and Training
Load Dataset: Load the dataset directly using the datasets library.
Tokenization: Since the dataset is comprised of raw text, each text entry will be tokenized for model input.
Fine-Tuning: Set up the training process, utilizing a trainer capable of handling fine-tuning efficiently.
# Results and Evaluation
After fine-tuning, evaluate the model's performance by generating text based on prompts derived from the dataset. Store logs and evaluation metrics for later analysis.

Evaluation: Test the model's performance with unseen prompts to assess its response generation capabilities.
Logging: Use tools like TensorBoard to visualize training metrics and evaluate results.
# Additional Considerations
Hyperparameters: Experiment with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs based on your hardware capabilities and dataset size.
Data Preprocessing: Additional preprocessing steps may be needed to clean the text and format it appropriately for training objectives.
