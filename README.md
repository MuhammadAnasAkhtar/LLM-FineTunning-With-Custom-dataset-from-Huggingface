# Fine-Tuning LLaMA-2 on Custom Dataset
This project focuses on fine-tuning the LLaMA-2 model using a custom dataset, specifically designed for datasets with three key columns: instruction, source, and output. The dataset used in this project is "TIGER-Lab/MathInstruct".

# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to fine-tune LLaMA-2 with supervised learning, training it to generate accurate responses based on custom instructions and contexts.

# Requirements
The following Python libraries are necessary:

transformers
datasets
torch
peft (for parameter-efficient fine-tuning)
# Dataset Structure
The custom dataset "TIGER-Lab/MathInstruct" contains:

instruction: The primary task or instruction.
source: Additional context for the task.
output: The expected response for each task.
# Setup and Training
Load Dataset: The dataset is loaded as a single training dataset.

Tokenization: The instruction and source columns are combined to form the input text, while the output column is used as the target label for training.

Fine-Tuning: The SFTTrainer is configured with specific training arguments for efficient supervised fine-tuning. Hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epoch count are defined for optimal performance.

# Results and Evaluation
After training, the model can be evaluated on various tasks to determine its performance and accuracy on similar instruction-based datasets. Logs and results are stored in designated directories for further analysis and refinement.
